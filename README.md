# Alexsis Wheaton - Data Analyst Portfolio.
## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Alexsis. I am a Data Analyst who strives to pose and answer
questions with quantitative-driven insights. In the process of development and
continuous learning, I have learned the importance of having an iterative approach to
analysis that is hypothesis oriented. I have a solid foundation in statistical analysis,
visualization, and the use of programming languages, such as Python and SQL. Through
various coursework and projects and projects, I have gained hands-on experience in
cleaning transforming data, conducting exploratory data analysis, and building
predictive models. Based on my technical skills and a strong analytical mindset, I am
optimistic that I can analyze and provide insight on large data sets that will lead to
successful business decisions.

In my spare time I enjoy reading and watching true crime, skating and biking in the 
park, cooking new recipes, and playing The Sims.
